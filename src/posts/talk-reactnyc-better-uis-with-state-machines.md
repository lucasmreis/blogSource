In my [quest](http://lucasmreis.github.io/blog/learning-elm-part-1/) for [correctness](http://lucasmreis.github.io/blog/from-elm-to-fable/), [reliability](http://lucasmreis.github.io/blog/learning-reasonml-part-1/), and [safety](http://lucasmreis.github.io/blog/the-single-most-important-driver-of-software-quality/) in software design, I've recently come accross State Machines, more specifically Statecharts. In this talk I explain benefits of planning your code, using Statecharts as a tool, and integrating them with your React code.
