Starting small project. Grunt? Gulp? NPM itself?

How NPM scripts work? Also say that -g is not needed anymore. babel-node example

Project organization: src, test and dist folders

NPM test: standard, good! Mocha with babel. 

Browserify with babel, copy HTML

NPM start: cd dist && httpserver

More tasks: sass, assets

It's already amazing. But what about watching files? 'onchange' lib > npm run build. Not very performant, let's do it one by one.

Some tools already have watch capabilities:node-sass and browserify, for instance.

Run a lot of scripts: parallelshell

deploy!

live-reload for added coolness
