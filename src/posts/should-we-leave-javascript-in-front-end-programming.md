I "inherited" a javascript project at work. It was "just a medium-sized React app", so we all thought it was going to be easy to get it up and running, and start getting productive with it - even though the application's only author was not there to help.

But no, it was not easy. A couple of hours until the build works, a couple of days until I can make any production-ready change. The difficulties I encountered in the process made me think a little bit about technology choice in programming.

The main question that I thought I knew the answer is: *should we implement the next front end project in javascript?*

## The Previous Answer

**Yes.** I believed a hundred percent that, even though there were some really interesting language choices in the radar, we should choose javascript. Simply because *that's what every developer in the market knows*, and *there's already a lot of libraries / frameworks that I can choose from*. Summing up, the main reason is *familiarity*, both with the syntax and the tools.

And that's what seems to have changed in web front end programming.

## Javascript Is Not One Language Anymore

<< Explain the differences >>

## New Technologies Are Better

<< Choose ES7 but not Elm? >>

One more time: should we implement the next front end project in javascript?

## Opportunity Cost

<< Not a yes/no, but a way of thinking: opportunity cost and the right tool for the job >>

<< ES7 is awesome, with a smaller learning curve, so maybe stick to it because of the tools >>

<< ClojureScript and Elm are better, and the tools are getting better everyday >>

<< Not so sure: small changes can lead to local maxima, but can completely miss global maximas >>

## The New Answer

**A not very sure yes.** And I think with little time it will be a "no".

<< React Native, WebAssembly, Elixir + Elm, Clojure + ClojureScript >>
