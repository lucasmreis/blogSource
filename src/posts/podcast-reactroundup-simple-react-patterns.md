After the [React patterns blog post](http://lucasmreis.github.io/blog/simple-react-patterns/) got a lot of attention, I was invited to React Round Up podcast as a guest. It's a very interesting conversation, and we go through all the patterns listed in the post!

Fun fact: Charles Max Wood, the podcast presenter, invited me to be a panelist after this episode :)
