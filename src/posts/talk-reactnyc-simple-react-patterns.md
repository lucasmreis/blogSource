This talk is based on the [popular](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15667778) [blog post](http://lucasmreis.github.io/blog/simple-react-patterns/) on React patterns. 

Fun fact: it's also my first talk in English :)

**UPDATE December, 2018**: React is changing a lot, with interesting features like the new Context and Hooks. I plan to update on those patterns in 2019, but not before some production use, so I can _really_ understand what is useful and what is not!
